#  SQL – MySQL

- This folder contains a collection of SQL problems I’ve solved across different concepts in MySQL, including querying, joins, subqueries, aggregation, and database design.
- It reflects my hands-on practice and understanding of database operations through real-world examples and exercises.
- Many of these problems were solved with the assistance of LLMs (like ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude) to better understand concepts, debug issues, and optimize queries.
- I also used platforms like HackerRank, LeetCode, and DataLemur. Here, I aim to share almost everything I practiced and learned from these platforms.

## **Topics:**
1. SELECT: Retrieve specific columns.
2. Column Aliases: Rename columns for readability (e.g., SELECT column_name AS alias).
3. FROM: Specify the table to query.
4. WHERE: Filter rows using conditions (=, <, !=, BETWEEN, IN, LIKE, NOT).
5. Logical Operators: Combine conditions with AND, OR, NOT.
6. Sorting & Limiting: Use ORDER BY (ASC/DESC), LIMIT (restrict rows), and OFFSET (skip rows).
