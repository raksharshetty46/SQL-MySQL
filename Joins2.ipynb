    "\n",
    "### 1. INNER JOIN Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question 1.1:** Find all customers and their order details, showing customer name, email, order date, and total amount. Include only customers who have actually placed orders.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question 1.2:** Display all order items with their corresponding product names and categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question 1.3:** Show customers from New York or Los Angeles who have completed orders, including order details.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. LEFT JOIN Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question 2.1:** List all customers and their orders (if any). Show customers even if they haven't placed any orders.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question 2.2:** Display all products and their order quantities (if any). Include products that were never ordered.\n",
    "\n",

    "## Key Learning Points\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **INNER JOIN**: Returns only matching records from both tables\n",
    "2. **LEFT JOIN**: Returns all records from left table + matching from right\n",
    "3. **RIGHT JOIN**: Returns all records from right table + matching from left\n",
    "4. **FULL OUTER JOIN**: Returns all records from both tables\n",
    "5. **CROSS JOIN**: Returns Cartesian product of both tables\n",
    "6. **SELF JOIN**: Joins a table with itself using aliases\n",
    "\n",
    "## Performance Tips\n",
    "\n",
    "- Always use appropriate indexes on join columns\n",
    "- Consider the size of tables when using CROSS JOIN\n",
    "- Use WHERE clauses to filter data early\n",
    "- INNER JOINs are typically faster than OUTER JOINs\n",
    "- Be careful with NULL values in join conditions"
